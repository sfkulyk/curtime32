Utility print all arguments to the standard output.
There are a lot of substitution combination, started with $ character (see curtime32 /help).
You can use + and - changing output date, also you can use timestamp to set output date (it will not change system date/time).
There are english and russian names for weekdays and months.
Formatted output could be executed with "/exec" command.

Purpose
Many years ago there were any tools for windows that could produce formatted date/time output like Unix/Linux "date".
Program continues CurTime tool (that was written for dos), so curtime32 works under win32.
There were a lot of issues disappears during this modernisation:
* No issues with long file names
* No command line lenght limitation
* Only wind32 api uses, so no dos-machine routines
* executes much faster

You can download source package with compiled binaries for curtime32 and 16-bit curtime.
