  This utility is freeware, if you will keep this text file within the executable,
    if you want to share utility with somebody else also please copy text file too.
  Program was compiled for DOS, so should work with all DOS versions and earlies
     Windows 9x series.
  According to DOS command line limits, the maximum length is 128 bytes/characters.

2. Purpose:
  Program shows all the arguments to stdout, but you can use character
    substitution, which will be replaced with special values (see help below)
  This tool was written do simplify batch scripting under DOS and windows.
  There are useful options, for example to generate a line and execute it.

3. Usage:

a) write to log file with specifying date. The name of log file also
     contains month and day:
   --- start of backup.bat ---
   curtime "Archiving started $T" /file d:\backup\$d$M.log
   rar a -r d:\backup\periodic.rar c:\base\*.*
   curtime "Archiving completed $T$c==========" /file d:\backup\$d$M.log
   ---- end of backup.bat ---

b) perform archiving of database files using rar archiver. Name of archiver
     contains current year, month and day:

   --- start of backup.bat ---
   curtime "rar.exe a -r \"d:\Backup_$y$M$d.rar\" c:\bases\*.*" >>temp.bat
   call temp.bat
   del temp.bat
   ---- end of backup.bat ---

c) The previous example with /exec option:

   --- start of backup.bat ---
   curtime "rar.exe a -r d:\Backup_$y$M$d.rar c:\bases\*.*" /exec >>backup.log
   ---- end of backup.bat ---

d) Utility supports input redirections:

   echo Today we have $V|curtime
   type text.txt|curtime

4. curtime.exe
    Without arguments curtime will wait for input from stdin

   curtime.exe arg1 arg2 arg3... argn [| > >> output]
    output - if /file option is not used, stdout will be used by default
    you can put arguments to quotas, without quotas, arguments will be
     concatenated into single string with the space as separator 

      curtime arg1 arg2     = "arg1 arg2"
      curtime arg1   arg2   = "arg1 arg2"
      curtime "arg1   arg2" = "arg1   arg2"

   You can redirect text from to curtime:
   echo arg | curtime.exe

     Options:

   -h               - Help
   /file <filename> - Output file (append)
   /exec            - Execute argument string
   /time            - Used only with /exec option or ignored.
                      With /exec options shows execution time

     Substitutes:

   $c - new line
   $p - space
   \" - quote character
   $$ - dollar character
   $T - time in format             [hh:mm:ss]
   $D - date in format             [Jan dd yyyy]
   $Z - date in format             [‗םג הה דדדד]
   $F - date/time in format        [Mon Jan dd hh:mm:ss yyyy]
   $f - date/time in format        [ם ‗םג הה קק:לל:סס דדדד]
   $Y - 4-digit year               [yyyy]
   $y - 2-digit year               [yy]
   $j - short month name           [Jan]
   $J - full month name            [January]
   $g - short rus month name       [‗םג]
   $g - long rus month name        [‗םגאנ]
   $M - month as a digit           [xx]
   $d - day of month               [xx]
   $n - day of week                [xx]
   $w - short name day of week     [Mon]
   $W - long name day of week      [Monday]
   $v - short rus name day of week [ם]
   $V - long rus name day of week  [מםוהוכםטך]
   $h - hours       [xx]
   $m - minutes     [xx]
   $s - seconds     [xx]
   $* - reset date/time to the current date/time
   $+xy - increase current date/time
   $-xy - decrease current date/time
          x - מע 0 המ 32000
          y - s-seconds, m-minutes, h-hours, d-days
          if x=1, you can skip it ($+1d is the same as $+d)
          These commands do not show anything, only changing the date.
          if you want to pring tomorrow date, use:
            "$+d$d" - add 1 day, show day of month.
            "$+2d$d$-5d$d$*$d"  add two days, show day of month (DoM),
                subtract 5 days, show DoM, set date to the current date, show DoM

5. Changes history:

 * 1.0   First release, shows date and time :)

 * 1.1   Added substitution to show full date
         Added substitution to show time only

 * 1.2   Added substitution to show date only
         Added $c - new line
         Added $p - space
         All the other texts will be printed as is

 * 1.3   Rewrite argument parsing, we can work with multiple arguments
         all substitutions start with $

 * 1.4   Added $y - yy
         Added $m - mm
         Added $w - ww

 * 1.5   Added quote support for arguments
         Created help option

 * 1.6   We can use localized text in command line

 * 1.7   Architecture changed to increase performance
         Everything works under DOS (not only in windows cmd)
         Significally decreases program size less than 20 kb

 * 1.8   New substitutions
         Using DOS functions for output
         Add \" to show quotes

 * 1.9   Fixed mistakes
         Names for day of week and month
         Uppercase and lowercase sensitivity for substitutes

 * 1.99  Added leading zeros

 * 2.0   Fixed issue with spaces in arguments without quotes
         Jun עוןונ June :)
         Date calculations performance improved
         Added possibility to add/subtract for current time
           For example, we can see the day of a week in 2000 seconds ;)
           add/sub supports for days, hours minutes, seconds
         Also added reset date/time to current

 * 2.10  15/04/02. A lot of rewriting to support /file option.
         The file name for /file option also can contain substitutes.
         For stdout we can use redirections now

 * 2.11  18/07/2003. Fixed error with date calculation.

 * 2.12  01/08/2003. Rewritten input/output to support standard stdin/stdout
         Now without arguments, program will wait for input
         To see help, now you must use -h option

 * 2.13  06/08/2003. Substitutions for russian names for days of week and months

 * 2.14  21/07/2004. Added powerful option /exec - which allows you to execute
         string after all substitutes were performed.
         May be /file not needs anymore. 
           before: curtime "Process started at $h:$m$c" /file $Y$M$d
              now: curtime "echo Process started at $h:$m >> $Y$M$d" /exec

         The second looks more "standard usage" of command line tools
         But I will keep /file option for backward compatibility
 * 2.15  Add /time - show execution time for /exec option
         Executing time: h:mm:ss (xx secs)
         If /file options is used, we do not print anything to stdout
 * 2.16  You can use shortened options (/exec = /ex = /e)
         Updated help and external file
